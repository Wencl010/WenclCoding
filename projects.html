                <h2>Cleveland Public School Website</h2>

                        My highest visibility work is the <a href="https://isd391.org" target="_blank"> Cleveland Public School website</a>. I started work on this in September 2020 when the school migrated to a new website company Thrillshare. Thrillshare is a drag-and-drop based website creator, similar to WordPress, but focused on the K-12 education market. Starting from Thrillshare's framework, I've made many custom modifications to make the website exactly how the school wanted. The home page is mostly stock, with only a few additional buttons and color changes, but most of the other pages rely on custom JavaScript to get the look the school wanted.

                        The most used component I've created for the site is by far the menu blocks pictured right. A user adds the menu to the page by pasting in a short block of code and then filling in their links & the type of each link. The code the user adds passes the information to my external script that creates the html and places it on the page. The menus can display links, emails, and dropdowns containing embedded PDFs. The PDFs are very important for the school as Thrillshare has no built-in way to embed a PDF and so previously the user had to download them.

                        One of my favorite pages is the <a href="https://www.isd391.org/page/image-gallery" target="_blank">Gallery Page</a> pictured below. We wanted to make the images in our news articles more visible because the articles were bumped off the home page in a matter of days. To solve this, I developed the gallery page. It pulls random pictures from old news articles and displays them. If you click on an image the page links you to the article it came from. The default selection is to pull pictures from an article in the current school year, but you can choose to browse old school years, by month, or all at once. If you don't change your filter and refresh with the More Images button, it won't show you the same image twice until it runs out of new images from the selected period. It wasn't the most complex page I've made, but I like it because it is such a fun way to bring more people to some of our older articles.

                        There are many more customizations I've made. From pages that update their content based on a Google Drive folder's contents, to the menus on the <a href="https://www.isd391.org/page/lunch-menu-food-service" target="_blank">food service page</a>. If you would like to talk more about what I've done with it contact me! This site has been a years-long project and it's impossible to talk about it all.

                <h2>Door Access Control Server</h2>
                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>
                        The door control server is my most recent project. This project's goal was to simplify the scheduling of doors for one-time events. The software we use to control the doors has the ability to schedule one-time events, but the setup process takes 5 to 10 minutes for a single event. In addition, since the setup a multi-step process, it is easy to make an error that leaves the building unlocked. To solve this, I created a Node.js server that uses the existing software's simple REST API to lock and unlock doors. The server uses the Node-Schedule package to handle the timing of the API calls to unlock the doors. It also uses a MySQL database to store data on existing schedules to allow users to make changes and to automatically restore all schedules after a server crash. While I was developing this project, the simplicity of the user interface and speed of development were the main requirements. Because of that the UI is very plain, and little time was spent on styling beyond making sure it was responsive. This allowed me to get the server up and running much quicker. In the future I plan on adding new features such as a history of previous schedules and improving the UI.

                    <p>
                        When I was presented I was asked to figure out how to improve the existing method for daily bulletins. That method was to put about 175 Google Docs in a shared folder, one Google Doc for each school day in the year, and it was a mess to maintain or use. To solve this issue, I first created a Google Sheet to hold the data for every bulletin and wrote a script to create a dated row for every day of the school year. I chose to use a Google Sheet over a database to keep it simple for authorized staff members to make changes to the data. I then developed scripts to fill in the birthdays for each bulletin and attached the script to a Google Form to allow unauthorized staff members to make some changes to the bulletin data automatically and submit other changes for approval. From there, I created a webpage to give the staff a simple user interface for viewing the data. The webpage displays all the information from the old method's bulletins. It also adds the lunch menu and events calendar from the school website so that staff only need to go to one site to get the information they want. Over time we also added other frequently used resources to the daily bulletin site to make it even more convenient.

                    <p>
                        I designed the layout of and set up much automation for the digital signage that is throughout the school. When putting up the digital signage a large concern was keeping the content on it fresh without adding much work for anyone. To accomplish that, I designed a program to transfer our news articles to the digital signage. The program supplies the 4 most recent articles and up to 5 images from each article to the digital signage every 15 minutes. If there are more than 5 images in an article, the program will rotate through them each time it supplies them. I also created programs to sync the announcements, events, and dining menus from the school website to the digital signage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final automation I set up was to make it easy for staff to upload images they wanted displayed on the digital signage. Our main goal was to have staff be able to upload content from their phones in a way that was second nature for them. The simplest answer for the staff was a Google Form. Using Google Apps Script running on submission of the form, I process the response and determine if the user needs approval before posting. If the user does need approval, their response is added to an admin-only Google Form, and the admin are notified they need to open the form and approve it. If the user doesn't need approval, or once an admin approves it, the program uses the digital signage's API to upload the content and publish it on the channels specified in the form response.

                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>
                        This project syncs the school's athletics calendar program to the events section of the school's website. Its goal was to reduce the workload on the employees in charge of maintaining the two systems and to reduce inaccuracies in the information displayed on the website. The athletics calendar program did not have a native way to interface with the Google Calendar that feeds our website. To solve this I developed a Google Apps Script program that parses an RSS feed generated by the athletics calendar. It then compares the events found on that feed to the existing events on the website calendar. If it finds a match it updates the event information for that event, otherwise, it creates a new event on the website calendar. Through all the executions it tracks what events it has added to the website calendar and if an event it previously added is no longer part of the RSS feed it deletes the old event. This project had many challenges. For one, the RSS feed URL had no documentation for its parameters and required reverse engineering to get the feed to provide events for all sports. Another challenge was that each sport had slight differences in how the RSS feed formatted the information. That required careful filtering when parsing the events to have the event show up correctly on the website. Over time, I also added the ability to sync specific sports from other school's athletics calendars so that our co-op sports schedules would show up on the website with our other sports.

                        While working at the school, I have worked on the setup and maintenance of three different open-source software servers. Shortly after I started working there, the school switched to using SnipeIt, an asset management software. Over the years, I have helped with maintenance and updates on it. In 2022, I set up Koha, an open-source library system, and this past summer, I took the lead on setting up osTicket, an open-source help desk software. I modified Koha and osTicket to make them match our branding and be more functional for our specific uses.
