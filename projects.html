                <h2>Cleveland Public School Website</h2>
                <div class="main-content">

                        My highest visibility work is the <a href="https://isd391.org" target="_blank"> Cleveland Public School website</a>. I started work on this in September 2020 when the school migrated to a new website company, Thrillshare. Thrillshare is a drag-and-drop-based website creator, similar to WordPress, but focused on the K-12 education market. Starting from Thrillshare's framework, I've made many custom modifications to make the website exactly how the school wanted. The home page is mostly stock, with only a few additional buttons and color changes, but most other pages rely on custom JavaScript.

                        The most used component I've created for the site is the menu blocks. A user adds the menu to the page by pasting in a short block of code and then filling in their links and the type of each link. The code block added by the user passes the information to my external script, which creates the HTML and places it on the page. The menus can display links, emails, and dropdowns containing embedded PDFs. The PDFs are very important for the school as Thrillshare has no built-in way to embed a PDF, so previously, the user had to download them to view them.

                        One of my favorite pages is the <a href="https://www.isd391.org/page/image-gallery" target="_blank">Gallery Page</a> pictured below. We wanted to make the images in our news articles more visible because the articles disappeared from the home page in a matter of days. To solve this, I developed the gallery page. It pulls random pictures from old news articles and displays them. If you click on an image, the page links you to the article it came from. The default selection is to pull pictures from an article in the current school year, but you can browse old school years, specific months, or everything at once. If you don't change the filter and refresh with the "More Images" button, the code won't show you the same image twice until it runs out of new photos. It isn't the most complex code I've written, but I like it because it is a fun way to bring more people to our older articles.

                        I've made many more customizations, from pages that update their content based on a Google Drive folder's contents to the menus on the <a href="https://www.isd391.org/page/lunch-menu-food-service" target="_blank">food service page</a>.

                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>
                        The door control server is my most recent project. This project aimed to simplify the scheduling of doors for one-time events. The software we use to control the doors can schedule one-time events, but the setup process takes 5 to 10 minutes for a single event. In addition, since the setup is a multi-step process, it is easy to make an error that leaves the building unlocked. To solve this, I created a Node.js server that uses the existing software's simple REST API to lock and unlock doors. The server uses the Node-Schedule package to handle the timing of the API calls to open the doors. It also uses a MySQL database to store data on existing schedules. This data allows users to make schedule changes and is used to restore schedules if the server crashes. While I was developing this project, the simplicity of the user interface and speed of development were the main requirements. Because of that, the UI is very plain, and I spent little time on styling beyond ensuring it was responsive. This allowed me to get the server up and running much quicker. A copy of the code can be found on my personal GitHub account <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Wencl010/DoorAccessControlServer">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        When I received this project, I was asked to improve the existing method for daily bulletins. That method was to put about 175 Google Docs in a shared folder, one Google Doc for each school day in the year, and it was a mess to maintain or use. To solve this issue, I first created a Google Sheet to hold the data for every bulletin and wrote a script to create a dated row for every day of the school year. I used a Google Sheet over a database to keep it simple for authorized staff members to change the data. I attached the scripts to a Google Form to allow all staff members to make some changes to the bulletin data automatically and submit other changes for approval. From there, I created a webpage to give the staff a simple user interface for viewing the data. The webpage displays all the information from the old method's bulletins. It also adds the lunch menu and events calendar from the school website so that staff only need to go to one site to get the information they want. Over time, we added other frequently used resources to the daily bulletin site to make it even more convenient.

                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>
                        I designed the layout of and set up much automation for the digital signage that is throughout the school. When putting up the digital signage, a significant concern was keeping the content fresh without adding extensive work for anyone. I designed a program to transfer our news articles to the digital signage to accomplish that. The program supplies the four most recent articles and up to five images from each article to the digital signage. If there are more than five images in an article, the program will rotate through them between cycles. I also created programs to sync the announcements, events, and dining menus from the school website to the digital signage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final automation I set up was to make it easy for staff to upload images they wanted displayed on the digital signage. Our main goal was to have staff be able to upload content from their phones in a way that was second nature for them. The most straightforward answer for the staff was a Google Form. Using Google Apps Script running on submission of the form, I process the response and determine if the user needs approval before posting. If the user requires approval, their response gets added to an admin-only Google Form. The administrators are then notified that they must open the form and approve the images. If the user doesn't need approval, or once an administrator approves it, the program uses the digital signage's API to upload the content and publish it on the channels specified in the form response.

                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>
                        This project syncs the school's athletics calendar program to the events section of the school's website. Its goal was to reduce the workload on the employees in charge of maintaining the two systems and to reduce inaccuracies in the information displayed on the website. The athletics calendar program did not have a native way to interface with the Google Calendar that feeds our website. To solve this, I developed a Google Apps Script program that parses an RSS feed generated by the athletics calendar. It then compares the events on that feed to the existing events on the website calendar. If it finds a match, it updates the event information for that event. Otherwise, it creates a new event on the website calendar. Through all the executions, it tracks what events it has added to the website calendar, and if an event it previously added is no longer part of the RSS feed, it deletes the old event. This project had many challenges. For one, the RSS feed URL had no documentation for its parameters and required reverse engineering to get the feed to provide events for all sports. Another challenge was that each sport differed slightly in how the RSS feed formatted the information. That required careful filtering when parsing the events to have them show up with the correct information. Over time, I added the ability to sync specific sports from other schools' athletics calendars so that our co-op sports schedules would show up on the website with our other sports.

                        I have spent many hours writing technical and user documentation for Cleveland Public School. Some pieces were for systems I created, and others were for programs the school purchased. Some examples can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/wencl-william/Public-Documentation" target="_blank" >Public-Documentation repository</a> on my Cleveland GitHub account.

                        While working at the school, I have worked on the setup and maintenance of three open-source software servers. Shortly after I started working there, the school switched to using SnipeIt, an asset management software. Over the years, I have helped with maintenance and updates on it. In 2022, I set up Koha, an open-source library system, and this past summer, I took the lead on setting up osTicket, an open-source help desk software. I modified Koha and osTicket to match our branding and be more functional for our specific uses.
